## Branches
- **Master Branch**
	- This branch should always be functional and committed to when features tested in Development Branch function correctly.  
- **Development Branch**
	- This branch is only for testing features to make sure they function correctly before merged to master.
	- Commit to this before to master.  
- **Backup Branch**
	- This branch should always be functional and serves as a backup in case the master branch breaks.
	- Commit to this at the end of each sprint.
- **Feature Branch**
    - Used for adding new features.
    - Each feature must have their own separate branch. (e.g. Feature/AI)
## Feature Completion
When a feature is completed and tested in its own branch, it is pushed to the dev-branch, tested and debugged here, and, if functional, is pushed to the master, where it is again tested and debugged. Once this is completed, it is tested and debugged in the build.

## Task Completion
Tasks are generally considered done if functional, committed to dev-branch and shown to our supervisor.  
A Task should not be moved to ``Done`` if not shown to supervisor, and should instead be moved to column ``Testing/Polishing`` to await approval.
